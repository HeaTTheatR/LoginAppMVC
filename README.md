Implementing the [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller) pattern for `Kivy framework` and `KivyMD` library.
The application demonstrates working with the `FireBase` database. The user enters his username and password,
clicks the "LOGIN" button, the application requests data about users from the database, verifies these data with the data
entered by the user and gives the result: whether the user entered the username and password correctly.

* Login - "Kivy"
* Password - "KivyMD"
